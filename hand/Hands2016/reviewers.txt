Dear {Recipient.Name},

Because of your substantial and related expertise, on behalf of HANDS2016 organizers, I would like to invite you to be a member of our technical program committee. Each member would review some paper drafts submitted to the workshop, in the period of (tentatively) 1st Apr to 1st May, 2016. 

HANDS2016 Workshop, in conjunction with CVPR 2016, is the attempt at gathering researchers who work on hand detection and hand pose estimation problems. Development of RGB-D sensors and camera miniaturization have opened the door to a whole new range of technologies and applications which require detecting hands and recognizing hand poses in a variety of scenarios. Most hand tracking data sets and papers have been focused on simple near-range front-on scenarios. This workshop attempts to move past this with the goal of evaluating a "breadth of applications" including: sign language recognition, desktop interaction, egocentric views, object manipulations, far range and over-the-shoulder driver footage.

Topics of interests are:

Hand detection
Hand pose and gesture recognition
3D articulated hand tracking
Hand modelling and rendering
Grasping and object manipulation
Hand activity recognition
Gesture interfaces
Egocentric vision systems
Structured prediction
Applications of hand pose estimation in AR/VR
Applications of hand pose estimation in robotics and haptics
