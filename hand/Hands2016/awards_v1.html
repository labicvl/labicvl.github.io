The School of Mechanical and Electrical and Computer Engineering at Purdue University is happy to support up to 22 travel awards of $600 each for students to travel to the HANDS workshop at the CVPR 2016*. These grants will be on a cost reimbursement basis so submission of receipts will be required.  Participants may contact Michelle Sarault at <a href="mailto:msarault@purdue.edu">msarault@purdue.edu</a> for instructions for completing the requirements for the travel award. Please obtain a short letter from your academic advisor and send it along with a short note of your interest in the HANDS workshop to Michelle Sarault. The awards will be made on a first come basis until the maximum support possible is reached. These awards are made available through funding from the National Science Foundation CMMI division through the award: Affordable Design through Realistic Interactions for Virtual Explorations award to Professor Karthik Ramani at Purdue University.</p>
