<h2> Aims and Scope </h2>

<img src="images/images.png" width="100%"/>
<p>
Last year, the first HANDS workshop was successfully held during CVPR'15 
and enjoyed by those who involved. You can find more details of HANDS 2015 <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~jsupanci/HANDS-2015/" target="_blank">here</a>.
</p>

<p>
For the second iteration, we will again attempt to gather
researchers who work on hand detection and hand pose estimation
problems, and acheive the goal of evaluating a "breadth of applications" 
including: sign language recognition, desktop interaction, egocentric views, object
manipulations, far range and over-the-shoulder driver footage. 
</p>

<p>
In the spirit of Chalearn "looking at people" for body pose estimation
or Pascal VOC Challenge for object recognition, we aim at comparing
new and established methods for hand detection and pose estimation on
a standard and varied data set covering multiple scenarios and
settings. We release such a dataset and encourage participants to use
it for evaluation and to participate in the challenge associated with
this workshop. 
</p>

<p>
Our program will feature several high-quality invited talks, challenge
results, oral and poster presentations of research, and a panel
discussion to identify key research questions and highlight future
research directions. As we want to encourage cross-pollination of
ideas from related fields such as robotics, HCI, machine learning, and
computer vision, we invite submissions of theoretical and applied
papers in all areas covered by the workshop, including, but not
limited to:
